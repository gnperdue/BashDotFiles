My bash config files. The `bash_prof_local_x` files are symlinked to 
`bash_prof_local` on different machines (one desktop, one laptop, one
for Ttian (ORNL), and one for my ubuntu VMs).

Note that `gitignore_global` is linked also. `gitconfig` is not linked and
will generally require custom setup work.
